# sonosring
Script for homeassistant to use Sonos for doorbell. I stole this somewhere, but i really dont remember where.

The script will:

1. Take a snapshot of your current sonos configuration 
2. Isolate (unjoin any multiroom setup)
3. Set the desired volume
4. Play a Wav file located in your www folder
5. Restore your sonos configuration
